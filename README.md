# Getting Started with Create React App

Building Aconews was an incredible adventure that pushed my skills and creativity. Using Firebase as my hosting platform for its real-time capabilities and ease of use. The development process involved designing a clean interface and integrating Firebase for user authentication and content management. I faced several challenges, like optimizing load times and ensuring mobile responsiveness, but each obstacle was a learning experience that helped me grow as a developer. Launching Aconews was a proud moment, knowing I created a platform that delivers timely news in a user-friendly way. This journey has been a fulfilling blend of technical growth and creativity!

Tech Stack for AcoNews
Frontend:

Framework: React.js (for building a dynamic user interface)
State Management: Redux
Backend:

Hosting: Firebase Hosting

APIs:
News API: (to fetch news articles from various sources)

This stack provides a solid foundation for building a scalable, responsive, and user-friendly news web app. Feel free to customize any part based on your preferences!

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.
